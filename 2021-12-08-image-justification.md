# Why the portfolio incorporated images taken from a personal camera.

In terms of content production, there are several forms, ranging from moving images, to text, to still images taken by cameras (Segura, nd). I decided to utilise still images as a fundamental part of my website, because they play a core role in making website content and blog posts more 'digestable' for viewers (Segura, nd). Moreover, Segura (nd) also suggests that still images taken by modern smartphones are highly sophisticated, and can have filters applied to them to supplement a clear and aesthetic viewing experience.

Thus, the image served as an integral part of my content production. I used my own camera, thereby cutting costs down to a minimum, as I didn't have to pay for any images owned by other individuals. Crucially, still images can either be taken from the internet/external sources, or by one's own camera (Hofstadter, nd). As a result, there are complex laws, rules and regulations to which individuals taking images from external sources must abide, in order to avoid copyright infringements upon the publishing of a public website.

Consequently, I decided to utilise my phone's camera to take pictures for my website, thus preventing me from being subject to legal complications. However, this should not disregard the 'sources for taking' (Hofstadter, nd) available to individuals trying to create websites. As embodied by websites such as [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/images/stock), there are large online repositories that store free stock images for individuals to freely use. Therefore, although I chose to use my camera to avoid legal and copyright issues, and due to the practical convenience of owning a powerful camera embedded in my phone, it should be noted that there are high quality images readily available for the taking, emphasising the diverse array of content avilable to website creators.
