# Digital identity reflective essay.

Digital identity underpins the ways in which individuals present themselves in the online domain 
(Camp, 2020). Online, individuals divide their identities into differing categories, which White and Le 
Cornu (2011) see as the segregation between the professional (institutional; formal) and personal 
(subjective; unprofessional) aspects of our lives, in line with being visitors (leaving no social trace 
behind online) and residents (leaving behind a social trace of one’s identity online). Therefore, the 
concept of digital identity is multi-faceted – differing between individuals across time – and based on
personal motivations. This essay aims to address the evolution of my digital identity by relating my 
use of digital platforms in the past, present, and future, to White and Le Cornu’s (2011) ‘visitors and 
residents’ model, thereby demonstrating how online platforms in contemporary society can act as 
catalysts for the progression of professional identities.

Five years ago, during my secondary school education, my digital identity was largely 
underdeveloped, particularly within the professional resident domain of White and Le Cornu’s digital 
identity continuum (2011). Whereas Prensky (2001:1) notes that students in contemporary 
educational institutions are ‘digital natives’ – technologically confident – my experience differs 
dramatically, as my confidence in using technology to express ideas related to both my professional 
and personal identity five years ago was low [(Figure 1.)](di-reflection.md). White (2014a) suggests the lack of 
motivation amongst students to convey their professional digital identities as ‘residents’ is due to 
the blurring of boundaries between personal and professional domains. Subsequently, students are 
reluctant to publish professional works online as they fear that aspects of their personal lives may be 
accessed by virtual strangers, generating a feeling of exposure. Hence, my digital identity in 
secondary school was largely restricted to the visitor domain of the digital identity continuum
(2011): the internet was a tool, assisting me solely by providing information for personal and 
professional projects, leaving no social trace of my digital footprint, subsequently providing a feeling 
of security. 

Nevertheless, I had not been exposed to the dearth of educational online platforms that I now have 
access to at university, like the online Albert Sloman Library website, which has facilitated the 
development of my professional visitor identity by supplying me with a wealth of credible, 
educational papers, thereby assisting me in carrying out research. White (2014a) elaborates on this 
with the notion of ‘emerging’ forms of knowledge publication, such as blogs and online journals, 
which are displacing traditional forms of publication and enabling students to express their 
professional identities from a younger age, coinciding with the inevitable expansion of my 
professional resident identity in the present [(Figure 2.)](di-reflection.md).

Therefore, my professional digital identity has shifted from primarily being in the visitor domain of 
White and Le Cornu’s continuum (2011), towards the resident side, albeit only a slight adjustment 
due to my online skills only beginning to develop. White (2014b) underlines how, historically, 
students didn’t formulate professional resident identities until they published their PhDs and 
university theses. Today, however, the web acts as a vehicle for presenting professional opinions and 
unfinished professional work, as embodied by the explosion of educational blogs and websites run 
by students (White, 2014b). WhatsApp, for instance, is a social media outlet that I have started to 
utilise to connect with other students within my classes and debate the content of lectures, enabling 
me to develop my professional ideas as a resident online, leaving behind a social trace of my digital 
identity in the form of images and opinions.

Importantly, however, is the fact that the online platforms I am using to develop my professional 
identity are highly privatised – not open to virtual strangers for open scrutiny – reflecting a sense of 
anxiety to progress my professional resident identity. White (2014b) argues that students today may 
have underdeveloped resident professional identities because publishing unfinished or opinionated 
work online can face them with unfiltered criticism, discouraging them (particularly if opinions 
published are in a subject area locked firmly within a set ideological paradigm), from becoming 
residents online. Despite this, I am currently using the web as an interactive educational community 
to generate feedback from a diverse audience. As White (2014b) stresses, the web is a setting of 
‘open practice’ that can connect academic individuals together through formal debate and feedback,
fostering professional resident identities. Thus, my digital identity today differs from my past digital 
identity, as I am gradually becoming more of a resident, as evidenced by contributions to 
educational group chats on social media and group meeting platforms like zoom, although most of 
this identity is privatised and shared with like-minded students, conforming to White’s (2014b) 
acknowledgement of students feeling a sense of vulnerability when publishing professional work 
online.

Considering my professional digital identity has become more resident due to growing confidence in 
relaying educational ideas to others online, in the next five years, I would expect my digital 
professional identity to become increasingly resident as I engage with more online institutional 
platforms and start using them to publish more unfinished projects for feedback. Anderson and 
Rainie (2014:5) perpetuate this: through a series of online, open-ended surveys with 2,558 
technological experts, they concluded that technology is due to flow ‘like electricity’ through 
individuals’ lives, penetrating educational domains and private spheres, resulting in the growing 
prominence of resident professional digital identities as individuals become more technologically 
immersed. Therefore, as [Figure 3.](di-reflection.md) suggests, I predict that my professional digital identity will become 
more resident as traditional educational institutions to which I belong become more affiliated with
digital technologies and actively provide students with the skills and platforms to voice their 
professional ideas. As my educational career progresses, I will increasingly publish work online, such 
as online blog posts and university theses, although I will only do this assuredly once the institutions 
I work within train me adequately, and inform me on how to safely progress my professional 
resident identity. Furthermore, the social media platforms I currently use to facilitate my personal 
digital identity may also be used in five years to grow my presence as a professional resident. For 
instance, I may use Reddit and Facebook to discuss essay topics online, and as methods of data 
collection for university theses, as social media platforms provide access to an array of opinions and 
cultures, assisting me in carrying out representative research. Thus, as my confidence in the online 
domain grows, I will be more inclined to be a resident, leaving behind a social trace of my 
professional identity.

In conclusion, my digital identity has transitioned from the visitor domain of White and Le Cornu’s 
(2011) continuum, to a more centralised, resident position, as I have familiarised myself with how to 
use digital technologies to facilitate my professional identity. This can be exemplified by my use of
social media group chats with academic peers, acting as conduits for the discussion of institutional 
content in a private environment. In five years, I predict that my resident professional identity will 
develop as I begin to publish more unfinished educational projects online for constructive peer 
review. Nevertheless, coinciding with White’s (2014a) argument that the online domain is ‘open 
practice’ that exposes professional residents to a multitude of opinions and criticisms, I also predict 
that most of my resident professional identity will be driven by private group chats which are 
shielded from digital strangers, protecting me from unfiltered criticism. Moreover, blurring personal 
and professional identities (White, 2014a) in contemporary digital society means that I will perhaps 
always tend to be more of a professional visitor online, to veil aspects of my personal life from the 
public.
