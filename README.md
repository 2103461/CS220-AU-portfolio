# CS220 AU portfolio

<br>

## Portfolio items
The portfolio you submit needs to contain the following:

1. **website** (40% of your overall mark) - a simple website supporting your institutional/professional identity (or one of your projects) using the `index.md` file and the GitHub Pages function. The current `index.md` file is a basic example for outlining your professional identity - change it as necessary.
2. **di reflection** (40% of your overall mark) - a short written work (essay) reflecting on developing your digital identities including both, visitor and resident modes (White, 2013). You can write this reflection in your preferred word editor (e.g. Word, Google Docs, Open Office) but you must submit it as a PDF file on FASER. If you are confident with this writing being public, please add it as an additional page to your website using Markdown language in the `di-reflection.md` file. The current content of this file can give you some ideas for reflecting on digital identities in general and on developing your own digital identities - change it as necessary.
3. **self-and peer-assessment** (10% of your overall mark) - the CS220 AU marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file to help streamline your progress. Before you submit, use this file to evaluate your work and give feedback on one of your classmates' work.
4. **portfolio overview** (10% of your overall mark) - a succinct overview of your portfolio and an outline of completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in the `README.md` file. Consider this `README.md` file, the one you are reading now, as a template - change it as necessary.

After you finish these items, add your student number and your portfolio's URL in the `final-check.md` file, complete a checklist in this file and along with the PDF version of your DI reflection, submit it on FASER. 

In essence, you need to submit two files on FASER:

1. di-reflection.pdf
2. final-check.md

But, before you submit, please rename both files to contain your student number e.g. like this:

1. 0610279-di-reflection.pdf
2. 0610279-final-check.md

# Overview

This portfolio comprises my website (a personal account of my professional identity and journey as a sociologist); a reflective essay based on White's (2013) model of digital identities; a self and peer asessment file that examines the overall success of my website in relation to pre-determined criteria; and this README.md file, which highlights the steps taken in developing the portfolio. This overview will systematically outline the different components in the portfolio and justify decisions made during the process of website design in particular.

The first component of this portfolio is the [website](https://2103461.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/), which entails the details of my professional identity, referring to the institutional practices and related to my sense of self (White, 2014). The core of the website focuses specifically on 'my sociological journey': a series of blog posts interwoven with images and hyperlinks that discusses my passion for the subject, how I developed my sociological skills, and where I may go with sociology in the future. All images used were taken by myself, thus avoiding issues of copyright (further justification is outlined in this [hyperlink](2021-12-08-image-justification.md)).
