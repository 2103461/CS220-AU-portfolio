# Digital identity reflection.

[White (2014)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPOG3iThmRI) suggests the ways that we utilise the online domain and present ourselves on the internet reflects our digital identities. These identites, White (2014) argues, are comprised of 4 sectors, creating a fluid continuum: the 'resident' zone, in which individuals leave a purposeful social trace of their activity behind; the 'visitor' zone, where individuals use the internet as a tool to perform a specific function, and subsequently leave behind no trace of their social identity; the 'personal' zone, referring to aspects of our identites that relate to our subjective interests and unprofessional activities; and the 'institutuional' (professional) zone, whereby individuals utilise online domains to facilitate educational or career-related interests and projects. Based off this framework, I contructed 3 of my own 'visitors and residents' maps, depicting my past, present and future digital identities, enabling me to reflect on how to develop my digital identity as a 'professional'.

As Figure 1. highlights, my past digital identity was confined to the 'visitor' domain as a 'professional'. This was due to a lack of insight into how to safely develop a professional identity in a digital society in which the lines between personal and institutional domains were blurring, fostering a feeling of breached privacy and uncertainty amongst students like myself.

Figure 2. accentuates clear development of my resident professional identity in comparison to my past (Figure 1.), primarily driven by educational group chats acting as catalysts for the development of 'professional' ideas in an interactive, safe, private, and constructive envrironment. However, the online platforms I am currently using to develop my professional identity are largely hidden from the general public and virtual strangers, e.g. private Whatsapp group chats, emphasising reluctance to receive criticism from outside of the educational institutions and academic social spheres to which I already belong. As a result, I currently remain mostly a professional visitor in regards to my digital identity.

## (Figure 3.) Future V+R map.

Figure 3. is a prediction of what my digital identity may look like in the future. As I become more aware of sophisitcated and secure searching strategies as a by-product of developing new skills in educational institutions in the future, and gain more confidence in expressing my professional ideas in public online domains, e.g. through blog posts and YouTube videos helping to promote my professional brand, my professional resident identity will become more prominent.
