# 'Visitors and residents' maps.

White (2014) suggests the ways that we utilise the online domain and present ourselves on the internet reflects our digital identities. These identites, White (2014) argues, are comprised of 4 sectors, creating a fluid continuum: the 'resident' zone, in which individuals leave a purposeful social trace of their activity behind; the 'visitor' zone, where individuals use the internet as a tool to perform a specific function, and subsequently leave behind no trace of their social identity; the 'personal' zone, referring to aspects of our identites that relate to our subjective interests and unprofessional activities; and the 'institutuional' (professional) zone, whereby individuals utilise online domains to facilitate educational or career-related interests and projects. Based off this framework, I contructed 3 of my own 'visitors and residents' maps, depicting my past, present and future digital identities, enabling me to reflect on how to develop my digital identity as a 'professional'.
