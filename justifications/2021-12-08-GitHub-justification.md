# Why GitHub was selected as my website's platform.

Static site generators (SSG), such as GitHub, precreate viewable HTML pages from user-generated templates (Gatsby, no date). Conversely, Mischook (2018) defines web content management systems (WCMS) as softwares that generate HTML pages in response to individuals requesting to view content in a database, enabling individuals with no prior experience of web content management to create dynamic and aesthetic websites. 

Although WCMSs, such as Wix and Wordpress, make it easier for individuals to create vivid websites through pre-generated, professional templates, which may be restricted behind paywalls, SSGs, which tend to require a greater degree of skill to utilise due to prerequisite coding/markdown knowledge being required, are typically free and budget-friendly, as exemplified by GitHub, and are faster then WCMSs, due to files not having to be generated or stored in a database, reflecting the 'static' nature of the software (Gatsby, no date). Furthermore, Mischook (2018), suggests that SSGs are ultimately more secure than WCMSs, because it is solely the system administrators that request and enforce changes when required, reducing the potential impact of code injection. Thus, due to SSGs being faster as a result of not constantly needng updating/changing, unlike dynamic WCMSs, and more secure than WCMSs, I decided to use GitHub as my website platform. Nevertheless, if I was to create a website that would be broadcast to a wider audience, the more aesthetic and visually-appealing nature of WCMSs would perhaps make them more useful than less user-friendly SSGs that require knowledge of markdown language and consequently do not facilitate the degree of visual creativity that WCMSs foster (Hofstadter, no date).
