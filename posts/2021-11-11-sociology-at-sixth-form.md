# My Sociology sixth form experience: further insight into social inequality.

At sixth form, Sociology placed significant emphasis on unearthing the social inequalities within and perpetuated by social institutions, such as the media, family units, religions, the education system, and the criminal justice system.

As the image above displays, the inequalities associated with social institutions are broad, encompassing multiple, intersecting facets of social characteristics, such as ethnicity, social class and gender, illustrating how social divisions in contemporary society are complex; the experience of social inequality cannot seemingly be generalised as oppression is an indivisualistic experience.

As KimberlÃ© Crenshaw in her 1989 essay 'Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex' states:

> 'This focus on the most privileged group members marginalizes
those who are multiply-burdened and obscures claims that cannot
be understood as resulting from discrete sources of discrimination.' (140)

Overall, my sixth form experience illuminated to me the extent to which inequality is not an experience unique to the United Kingdom, nor an experience that impacts individuals uniformly in society. In fact, inequality is often covert in society - the individuals that have to endure it are often marginalised and silenced, maintaining society's unjust hierarchies of power.

Yet, this covertness is the reason inequality persists, which has driven me towards studying Sociology at university, in hopes that I can not only gain a better insight into how inequalities operate and where they reside, but also unearth and expose these inequalities, potentially producing work in the future that drives positive social change, leading to small steps towards a less segregated and hierarchichal society.
