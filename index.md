Hi, I'm Sam. As the title says, I'm an undergraduate Sociology student at the University of Essex with a particular interest in sociological theory, education, and social inequality and the steps required to reduce it. Currently, I work in a general village maintenance role in my home town Alresford and have a passion for preserving a sustainable physical environment and biodiverse ecosystems. Outside of my professional endeavours, I'm also an avid gamer, footballer, cook and fitness enthusiast, who is excited to undergo self-improvement and contribute towards unearthing social injustices and providing a voice for oppressed groups within society.

# My Sociology sixth form experience: further insight into social inequality.

At sixth form, Sociology placed significant emphasis on unearthing the social inequalities within and perpetuated by social institutions, such as the media, family units, religions, the education system, and the criminal justice system.

As the image above displays, the inequalities associated with social institutions are broad, encompassing multiple, intersecting facets of social characteristics, such as ethnicity, social class and gender, illustrating how social divisions in contemporary society are complex; the experience of social inequality cannot seemingly be generalised as oppression is an indivisualistic experience.

As KimberlÃ© Crenshaw in her 1989 essay 'Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex' states:

> 'This focus on the most privileged group members marginalizes
those who are multiply-burdened and obscures claims that cannot
be understood as resulting from discrete sources of discrimination.' (140)

Overall, my sixth form experience illuminated to me the extent to which inequlity is not an experience unique to the United Kingdom, nor an experience that impacts individuals uniformly in society. In fact, inequality is often covert in society - the individuals that have to endure it are often marginalised and silenced, maintaining society's unjust hierarchies of power.

Yet, this covertness is the reason inequality persists, which has driven me towards studying Sociology at university, in hopes that I can not only gain a better insight into how inequalities operate and where they reside, but also unearth and expose these inequalities, potentially producing work in the future that drives positive social change, leading to small steps towards a less segregated and hierarchichal society.

# Current Sociological project: the ideologically manipulative role of the media.

Upon achieving an A* at A Level Sociology, which was the subject I most thoroughly enjoyed, I decided to study it further, justifying my current status as a University of Essex student. The inequalities that A Level Sociology highlighted to me steered me towards studying how inequalities are perpetuated today. Thus, in my [SC106 'Media, Culture and Society' module](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SC106), when I was given the chance to study and write about the ideological role of the media, I took the opportunity.

My essay aims to explore how the media - debatably the most contemporary and relevant institution that has penetrated into our social realms in digital society - shapes our perceptions of normality through stereotyping and underrepresentation. Through ideology that is ultimately controlled and moulded by the ruling-class elite within society, our perceptions of race, gender, age and ethnicity are manipulated in an attempt to uphold the existing (disgustingly unequal!) social order.

Therefore, after reading my essay, I hope that you - the viewer, who, like me, has the potential to reveal and challenge injustice - will be more alert to the fact that what we consume everyday - the content of the mass media - is politically distorted, but can also be used as a catalyst to initiate positive social change.
