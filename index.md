Hi, I'm Sam.

# Current Sociological project: the ideologically manipulative role of the media.

Upon achieving an A* at A Level Sociology, which was the subject I most thoroughly enjoyed, I decided to study it further, justifying my current status as a University of Essex student. The inequalities that A Level Sociology highlighted to me steered me towards studying how inequalities are perpetuated today. Thus, in my [SC106 'Media, Culture and Society' module](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SC106), when I was given the chance to study and write about the ideological role of the media, I took the opportunity.

My essay aims to explore how the media - debatably the most contemporary and relevant institution that has penetrated into our social realms in digital society - shapes our perceptions of normality through stereotyping and underrepresentation. Through ideology that is ultimately controlled and moulded by the ruling-class elite within society, our perceptions of race, gender, age and ethnicity are manipulated in an attempt to uphold the existing (disgustingly unequal!) social order.

Therefore, after reading my essay, I hope that you - the viewer, who, like me, has the potential to reveal and challenge injustice - will be more alert to the fact that what we consume everyday - the content of the mass media - is politically distorted, but can also be used as a catalyst to initiate positive social change.
