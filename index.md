Hi, I'm Sam. As the title says, I'm an undergraduate Sociology student at the University of Essex with a particular interest in sociological theory, education, and social inequality and the steps required to reduce it. Currently, I work in a general village maintenance role in my home town Alresford and have a passion for preserving a sustainable physical environment and biodiverse ecosystems. Outside of my professional endeavours, I'm also an avid gamer, footballer, cook and fitness enthusiast, who is excited to undergo self-improvement and contribute towards unearthing social injustices and providing a voice for oppressed groups within society.

# Year 11 Citizenship project: inspiring a sociological imagination.

In the final year of secondary school, part of my Citizenship course required me to raise awareness on a prominent form of social injustice. During 2017 - two years prior to the completion of my project - the number of rough sleepers in the South of England had risen by 194% on 2010's levels, illustrating a need for action regarding homelessness in the UK. Thus, my Citizenship project was directed at alerting people to the damaging effects of homelessness and funding the work of the Colchester Night Shelter.

After peer discussion, I decided upon a charity bake sale in order to raise money for the Colchester Night Shelter, teaming up with my peers to inform the members of my school on the importance of reducing the rapidly increasing homelessness rate, and providing charities with the means to assist rough sleepers through funds derived from cakes from the sale.

At the end of the bake sale, over £74 was raised for the Colchester Night Shelter!

If interested, explore the [Colchester Night Shelter](https://colchesternightshelter.org.uk) website for futher information on homelessness in the Colchester vicinity.

From this point, my interest in social inequalities was primed, hence I desired to explore them further by taking A level Sociology at the Colchester Sixth Form, in hopes of gaining insight into the ways in which power relations within society are unequally balanced.

# My Sociology sixth form experience: further insight into social inequality.

At sixth form, Sociology placed significant emphasis on unearthing the social inequlalities within and perpetuated by social institutions, such as the media, family units, religions, the education system, and the criminal justice system.

As the image above displays, the inequalities associated with social institutions are broad, encompassing multiple, intersecting facets of social characteristics, such as ethnicity, social class and gender, illustrating how social divisions in contemporary society are complex; the experience of social inequality cannot seemingly be generalised as oppression is an indivisualistic experience.

As Kimberlé Crenshaw in her 1989 essay 'Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex' states:

> 'This focus on the most privileged group members marginalizes
those who are multiply-burdened and obscures claims that cannot
be understood as resulting from discrete sources of discrimination.' (140)
