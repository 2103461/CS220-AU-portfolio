# **Sam Davies**
**Undergraduate Sociology student at the University of Essex.**

Hi, I'm Sam. As the title says, I'm an undergraduate Sociology student at the University of Essex with a particular interest in sociological theory, education, and social inequality and the steps required to reduce it. Currently, I work in a general village maintenance role in my home town Alresford and have a passion for preserving a sustainable physical environment and biodiverse ecosystems. Outside of my professional endeavours, I'm also an avid gamer, footballer, cook and fitness enthusiast, who is excited to undergo self-improvement and contribute towards unearthing social injustices and providing a voice for oppressed groups within society.

# Current Sociological project: the ideologically manipulative role of the media.

Upon achieving an A* at A Level Sociology, which was the subject I most thoroughly enjoyed, I decided to study it further, justifying my current status as a University of Essex student. The inequalities that A Level Sociology highlighted to me steered me towards studying how inequalities are perpetuated today. Thus, in my [SC106 'Media, Culture and Society' module](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/modules/Default.aspx?coursecode=SC106), when I was given the chance to study and write about the ideological role of the media, I took the opportunity.

My essay aims to explore how the media - debatably the most contemporary and relevant institution that has penetrated into our social realms in digital society - shapes our perceptions of normality through stereotyping and underrepresentation. Through ideology that is ultimately controlled and moulded by the ruling-class elite within society, our perceptions of race, gender, age and ethnicity are manipulated in an attempt to uphold the existing (disgustingly unequal!) social order.

Therefore, after reading my essay, I hope that you - the viewer, who, like me, has the potential to reveal and challenge injustice - will be more alert to the fact that what we consume everyday - the content of the mass media - is politically distorted, but can also be used as a catalyst to initiate positive social change.

# My sociological future: the development of my sociological imagination.

As my previous blogs demonstrate, I have been developing a sociological imagination for a while now!

Currently, I'm in my first year of university, and am exploring how the media perpetuates social inequalities in society. This is only a stepping stone in my sociological career, and I was thinking of dedicating this blog post to the discussion of where I may go with Sociology.

Thus, this blog post is going to be split into 3 key questions that relate to my future, and is dedicated to reflecting on my past in order to make predictions.

## ****1. What doors will the subject open for me?**** 

Sociology, for me, has honed some of the foundational skills that employers desire. 

In the summer of 2021, when I was being interviewed for an environmental conservation job for my local council, I was asked about what I could bring to the council that others couldn't. 

A ****daunting**** question!

I pasued, thinking to the skills I've harnessed throughout years of education. Suddenly, my mind raced to the concept of 'verstehen' - empathetic understanding - which sociology emphasises as being a pivotal research skill. Bingo: sociology has taught me to look through the eyes of others, and subsequently opened my eyes to the privileges I have theat others don't. Hence, I told the interviewers that as a result of my sociological imagination, which largely focuses on verstehen, I am able to defuse hostile situations efficiently by looking through the eyes of others, and acknowledging the sources of their frustrations.

This key skill, in my opinion, is what got me that job. So, in regards to the future, as my sense of empathy strengthens, I believe that I will be able to conduct highly personalised, deep, and sensitive social research, which will hopefully explore the perspectives and viewpoints of the social groups who are suppressed within society, and need a platform off which they can project their stories.

If I choose not to go down the route of social research in the long term, I believe that verstehen, alongside an assortment of other skills that sociology has taught me, such as time management, critical thinking and evaluation, the ability to debate, formal essay writing, and many more, will permit me to teach others and inspire future generations of sociologists!

Sociology, in summary, is like a key to jobs that are highly social, require good interactional skills, and are underpinned by verstehen.

## ****2. Which sociological topics will I explore further?**** 

Part of being a sociology student at university is the sociological research project that is conducted in the third year.

Many students fear this dissertation, due to the pain of referencing hundreds of credible sources, rereading pages of highly formal, original research, and the hundreds of hours spent gathering data and analysing findings.

Although I share this anxiety, I believe the third year dissertation is an opportunity for me to explore sociological topics that interest me.

But what are those topics? Where is my interest in sociology heightened?

To assess this, I thought back to my sociological past, and also consulted my present sociological projects. The common theme running throughout these periods, and my website in general, is a desire to tackle social inequality. 

I simply find it devastating that such blatant inequlities exist today, and that women, ethnic minority groups, the elderly, disabled individuals, members of the LGBTQA+ community, and so many more persist to be oppressed and denied basic rights and opportunities in society. From year 11 to today, I have constantly shown interest in raising awareness on social injustice, so this is the direction my research will take.

But you may be thinking, which strand of inequality? Indeed, writing a dissertation on inequality would ultimately take me centuries to complete, so I will have to consider which part of inequality most appeals to me. And the answer to that question, is gender.

At sixth form, a significant module I studied was on families and households, examining the processes and inequalities embedded in the very place we come to see as a safe haven - [home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpgZ5PCuf8A).

In particular, women have unequal experiences in comparison with men in the domestic sphere, as reinforced by women being faced with the burden of emotional labour, domestic chores and paid employment (Duncombe and Marsden, 1995), which men tend not to be, and women also taking the brunt of domestic violence [(Gilchrist, 2013)](https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=ym7BUe4MDK8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA159&dq=domestic+abuse+women+UK&ots=ATcE6yr55w&sig=7mKX6sB91SACQR1Un5gkDCOmI5g&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=domestic%20abuse%20women%20UK&f=false).

Thus, I can see my future sociological research and interests steering towards gender inequalities in society, as I beleive that women are still hugely subordinate to men in society, and consequently deserve to have their struggles illuminated as a means of driving positive social change.

## ****3. Why is sociology an important subject moving into the future?****

So far, I've discussed what sociology may enable me to do in the future, and which elements of sociology I believe I will study further. This leaves me with one more significant question to answer regarding the future of my sociological career: what is the purpose of studying sociology in the future? Why should I pursue a career related to the broad field of sociology?

When I first started studying sociology at university, this was something I questioned: I had a passion for a subject, but little idea of how relevant it may be in the future. 

Maths, science, and engineering, for example, are all conduits that power modern design and industry, and will always be crucial towards progressing technology and standard of living in society. Sociology, however, is more fluid: every finding can be debated and every researcher has differing interests, causing the subject to lack consensus, so how can sociology be of any use to tackling problems in the future?

I believe the answer lies in sociology's unique power to reveal perspectives and flaws in society that other subjects are unable to do. As stated by C. Wright Mills:

> ‘It is social and historical reality that men want to know, and often they do not find contemporary literature an adequate means for knowing it’ (2000 [1959]:17).

And it is sociology that reveals the structures that control our lives, shedding light on the factors that cause individuals to feel a sense of subjugation. It provides insight into the very forces that hamper women from breaking the 'glass ceiling' in the sphere of work; illuminates the historical factors that prevent ethnic minority groups from succeeding within the ethnocentric education system; accentuates the degree of oppression that children face in societies across the globe; and so much more!

Thus, as societies begin to rapidly expand as urbanisation rapidly enhances, and capitalism evolves as the dominant economic system, we need a means of comprehending these radical changes, and the myriad effects they will have on individuals: it is sociology that provides this illumination and allows us to challenge inequalities.

Sociology is the voice that society needs to reveal stories of injustice and power social progress. Without sociology, society will only become more unequal, so it is up to us - the sociologists of today - to speak up and foster equality.

## ****Conclusion****

This blog is a bit of a prediction.

I've retraced my steps taken as a sociologist in order to assess where I may go with sociology in the future, exploring future topics, career paths, and the need for sociology in the future. I've outlined the prominence of social inequality today, justifying the need for individuals in society to develop their sociological imaginations and challenge what they see and experience.

I hope you've enjoyed this short blog, and are inspired to change the world as you know it; it is up to individuals, like you and me, to use sociology as a framework of practices, perspectives and ideas to shape the future in a positive manner!
